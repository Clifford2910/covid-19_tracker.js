# Covid-19 Tracker

## Challenge

* The challenge was to create a single page React.js app that pulled API information about Covid-19 from several sources and presented it for the user.

### My Approach

* **TDD** - My approach was to use TDD to guide my code and make sure that what I was plugging in was working and returning what I wanted. I have only done minimal testing in React.js so I wanted to make sure that my focus and practice was on this.
* **Components** - I wanted to keep my attention on the separate components comprised to build the app and keep the App.js minimal, with the components being imported in and plugged into the html.

## Installation

* To clone the repo:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Clifford2910/covid-19_tracker.js.git
$ cd covid-19_tracker.js
```

## Usage

* To open the App:
```shell
$ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing (with Jest)

* To test the repo:
```shell
$ npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
